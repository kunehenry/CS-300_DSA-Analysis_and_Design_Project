# Project Reflection

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In these projects, I delved into two significant problems: analyzing the runtime and memory usage for different data structures (Project One) and developing a working code that sorts and prints a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order (Project Two).

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached these problems by selecting appropriate data structures to implement the required functionalities. The understanding of data structures is not just important, it's crucial because they directly impact the efficiency of the code in terms of both time and space complexity. For Project One, I performed a detailed analysis of vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees (BSTs) to understand their performance in different scenarios. I implemented the solution in Project Two using a hash table data structure to sort and manage course information effectively.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I faced several challenges during the projects, such as handling invalid input data and ensuring efficient performance for large datasets. I overcame these roadblocks by thoroughly debugging my code, utilizing pseudocode to outline my approach before implementation, and researching best practices for handling specific data structure operations. For example, dealing with hash collisions in hash tables requires a deeper understanding of hash functions and collision resolution techniques.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on these projects has significantly enhanced my software design and development skills. It's not just a learning experience, it's a leap forward. I have learned to prioritize efficiency and scalability by choosing suitable data structures. Additionally, analyzing and comparing different data structures has improved my decision-making skills when it comes to selecting the most appropriate tools for a given problem.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on these projects has refined my programming style to focus more on maintainability, readability, and adaptability. I have learned to write cleaner, modular code with clear documentation and comments, making it easier for others (and my future self) to understand and modify. Implementing functions with well-defined purposes and using descriptive variable names has also contributed to more readable code. Moreover, I have adopted practices that ensure my code can readily adapt to changing requirements or new features, such as using flexible data structures and avoiding hard-coded values.
